# Just some data compression tasks that might come in handy for someone

## Requirements

Most tasks will be done with [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl), so those are required.

## Usage

* Clone this repo
* Launch Pluto:
```sh
shell> julia
julia> import Pluto
julia> Pluto.run()
```
* Select the file you'd like analize/edit

## Note

I do take the time to translate to English from my native language, but I can't always guarantee it.
